# 🎬 Mini Recommender System

A simple yet powerful **Movie Recommendation System** built with **Streamlit** and **Python**, using both **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** approaches — plus a **hybrid mode** that combines the best of both worlds.

👉 **Live Demo:** [https://khadija-mouhtaj-mini-recommender-system.streamlit.app](https://mini-recommender-system.streamlit.app/)

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 **Content-Based Filtering** – recommends movies similar to a given one  
- 👤 **Collaborative Filtering** – recommends movies based on user preferences  
- ⚙️ **Hybrid Recommendation** – combines both methods for better accuracy  
- 🧠 Built on the **MovieLens 100K** dataset  
- 💡 Clean and interactive Streamlit interface
